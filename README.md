# Hi! I'm Victor. 

I love coming up and playing with ideas. 
Especially those that can be built using Javascript and shared with everyone!

I've been coding full-time since October 2019 and am still very much a newbie to the web dev community.

If you have a fun project that you're working on or know of that you think might be useful for a new dev like me to take a look at just tweet me at @vickean!

This github account is a journal that documents my journey from barely being able to code a simple site to being able to build frontends using ReactJS and backends using NodeJS.
